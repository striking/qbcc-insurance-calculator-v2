                Typically, the licensed contractor (builder) is responsible for taking out QBCC Home Warranty Insurance
                and paying the premium. However, this cost is usually passed on to the homeowner as part of the total
                project cost.

                <li>The insurance premium should be clearly itemized in your building contract</li>

                <li>
                  If you're an owner-builder, you'll need to take out insurance if you sell the property within 6 years
