      <h2>How QBCC Calculates Home Warranty Premiums</h2>
      <p>QBCC home warranty insurance premiums are calculated based on the contract value of your building work. The premium rates are set by the Queensland Government and are reviewed periodically.</p>
      
      <p>The current premium structure is tiered, with different rates applying to different value ranges of building work:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>For work valued up to $20,000, there is a flat premium rate</li>
        <li>For work valued between $20,001 and $200,000, the premium is calculated as a percentage of the contract value</li>
        <li>For work valued over $200,000, there are additional tiers with reducing percentage rates</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Factors That Affect Your Premium</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Contract Value</h3>
      <p>The total contract value is the primary factor in determining your premium. This includes all building work, materials, and GST.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Type of Construction</h3>
      <p>Different types of construction work may have different premium rates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New home construction</li>
        <li>Renovations and extensions</li>
        <li>Swimming pools</li>
        <li>Transportable homes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Builder Status</h3>
      <p>In some cases, the premium may be affected by the builder's history with QBCC, including their claims history and financial status.</p>
      
      <h2>Premium Calculation Example</h2>
      <p>For a new home with a contract value of $350,000:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Base premium calculation based on the tiered structure</li>
        <li>Application of any applicable discounts or loadings</li>
        <li>Addition of stamp duty and GST</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>The final premium would typically be between 0.5% and 1.5% of the contract value, depending on the specific circumstances.</p>
      
      <h2>When to Pay the Premium</h2>
      <p>The insurance premium must be paid before building work commences. The builder is responsible for arranging the insurance and paying the premium, but this cost is typically passed on to the homeowner as part of the building contract.</p>

      <h2>Insurance Requirements for New Construction</h2>
      <p>When building a new home in Queensland, QBCC home warranty insurance is mandatory for all residential construction work valued at $3,300 or more. This insurance provides protection for homeowners against:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Non-completion of building work</li>
        <li>Defective building work</li>
        <li>Subsidence or settlement</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>For new construction, the insurance coverage period is typically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Non-completion: 12 months from the date of contract</li>
        <li>Structural defects: 6 years and 6 months from either the contract date or when the premium is paid</li>
        <li>Non-structural defects: 12 months from practical completion</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Insurance Requirements for Renovations</h2>
      <p>For renovation projects, the insurance requirements depend on the nature and value of the work:</p>
      
      <h3>Renovations Valued at $3,300 or More</h3>
      <p>QBCC home warranty insurance is mandatory for renovation work valued at $3,300 or more that involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Structural changes to the building</li>
        <li>Addition of new rooms or extensions</li>
        <li>Major kitchen or bathroom renovations that involve plumbing or electrical work</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Exemptions for Certain Renovation Work</h3>
      <p>Some renovation work may be exempt from insurance requirements, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Painting (interior or exterior)</li>
        <li>Tiling (when not part of a bathroom renovation)</li>
        <li>Landscaping (when not part of a structural retaining wall)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Premium Calculation Differences</h2>
      
      <h3>New Construction Premiums</h3>
      <p>For new construction, premiums are calculated based on the total contract value, including all building work and materials. The premium rate is typically between 0.5% and 1.5% of the contract value.</p>
      
      <h3>Renovation Premiums</h3>
      <p>For renovations, premiums are calculated based on the value of the renovation work only. The premium rate structure is the same as for new construction, but since the contract value is typically lower, the premium amount is usually lower as well.</p>
      
      <h2>Documentation Requirements</h2>
      
      <h3>New Construction</h3>
      <p>For new construction, the builder must provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A signed building contract</li>
        <li>Detailed plans and specifications</li>
        <li>Building approvals from the local council</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Renovations</h3>
      <p>For renovations, the documentation requirements may be less extensive, depending on the scope of work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A signed contract describing the renovation work</li>
        <li>Plans and specifications (for major renovations)</li>
        <li>Building approvals (if required for the specific renovation)</li>
      </ul>
